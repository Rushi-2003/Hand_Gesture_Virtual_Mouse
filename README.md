🌟Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse
🌟

## 🖥️Introduction

The Hand Gestures Controlled Virtual Mouse is an innovative project aimed at creating a contactless way to interact with a computer. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the system interprets hand gestures and translates them into mouse actions, providing an intuitive and accessible user experience.

## 📜Background

With the increasing focus on touchless interfaces, there is a growing demand for systems that can interact with computers without physical contact. This project was developed as part of a third-year engineering course to explore how hand gestures can be utilized to control a virtual mouse. The main challenge was to create an accurate and responsive system that could recognize hand movements in real-time.

## ✨Features

Hand Gesture Detection: Recognizes specific hand gestures to control mouse movements and actions.
Customizable Gestures: Users can customize gestures for different actions like click, drag, and scroll.
Real-Time Processing: The system processes hand gestures in real-time, providing a smooth user experience.

## 🛠️Tools Used:

- **Python**: For scripting and implementing the logic of the application.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and gesture recognition.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework by Google for building multimodal ML pipelines, particularly used for hand detection and tracking.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Git**: Version control system to manage and track changes throughout the development process.

## 🔍Analysis

During the development, the initial dataset was found to be insufficient for training the gesture recognition model. This led to a decision to enhance the dataset by gathering additional hand gesture images and incorporating different lighting conditions and hand orientations. The improved dataset significantly increased the model's accuracy and responsiveness.

The gesture recognition algorithm was tested across various environments, and the system was fine-tuned to minimize false positives and latency. Performance metrics, including recognition accuracy and system latency, were evaluated to ensure that the virtual mouse was both effective and user-friendly.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The system uses the following steps to achieve gesture-based control:

- **Hand Detection**: Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system detects the user's hand in real-time.
- **Gesture Recognition**: The detected hand is analyzed to recognize predefined gestures.
- **Mouse Control**: Based on the recognized gesture, corresponding mouse actions (e.g., move, click, drag) are performed.

## 🎨Customization

You can customize the gestures recognized by the system by modifying the gesture.py script. Add new gestures or modify existing ones according to your requirements.

## 🎓What I Learned

Data Quality Importance: The success of machine learning models heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the dataset. The experience of identifying and addressing the shortcomings of the initial dataset was invaluable.
Team Collaboration: Leading the team through the process of improving the dataset taught me the importance of clear communication, persuasion, and teamwork in achieving a common goal.
Technical Skills: Enhanced my skills in Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, along with a deeper understanding of machine learning pipelines and computer vision techniques.

## 🏁Conclusion

The Hand Gestures Controlled Virtual Mouse project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using hand gestures for contactless computer interaction. The final system was able to accurately detect and respond to a variety of gestures, making it a viable alternative to traditional input devices like the mouse or trackpad. This project not only expanded my technical capabilities but also reinforced the importance of data quality and collaborative problem-solving in software development.
